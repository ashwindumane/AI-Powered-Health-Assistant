# AI-Powered Health Assistant

## Abstract
The AI-Powered Health Assistant project leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized healthcare support. This system offers real-time health monitoring, medical information dissemination, and preliminary diagnostic insights. It aims to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers, reducing delays in medical advice and enhancing overall patient outcomes.

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Patients, particularly in remote areas, face delays in accessing quality healthcare. The abundance of unverified online medical information can further confuse users.

### Motivation
Integrating AI in healthcare can offer timely, accurate, and personalized information, improving user engagement and reducing the load on medical professionals.

### Objectives
- Develop an AI assistant to understand and process natural language health queries.
- Provide accurate medical information and preliminary diagnostic suggestions.
- Ensure strict data privacy and security standards.

### Scope of the Project
Focuses on AI-driven natural language processing, user-friendly interface development, and initial diagnostic support with plans to integrate real-time health tracking in future updates.

## Proposed Methodology
### System Design
A modular architecture combining AI, UI (via Streamlit), and data management layers ensures scalability and robustness.
### Requirement Specification
**Software:**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Ubuntu Linux.
